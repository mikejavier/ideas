My new powered Google Keep

## Why
I use ~~google keep~~ a lot to jot down the project ideas I have, but seeing [bukinoshita/ideas](https://github.com/bukinoshita/ideas) repository... I thought why not bring everything to Github since the projects are to develop, it's all in the house and who knows, maybe even find a contributor.

## How will it work
For every new idea a new issue will be created, containing all the necessary information so that they can be fulfilled, they will be properly categorized and if they need, they will have time limits to be taken from the paper. You will also have a kanban board to track progress and when completed have to have a link to the online project or repository.

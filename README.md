# ideas
My new Google Keep

I use ~~google keep~~ a lot to jot down the project ideas I have, but seeing [bukinoshita/ideas](https://github.com/bukinoshita/ideas) repository... I thought why not bring everything to Github since the projects are to develop, it's all in the house and who knows, maybe even find a contributor.
